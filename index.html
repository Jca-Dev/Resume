            This role provided the opportunity to develop sales skills in a competitive industry.
            Organisational skills were paramount to my success in this role. I booked customers into the workshop diary
            utilising resources available to maximise profits and meet customer expectations.
            I sold motorbikes and accessories working toward sales targets. I educated customers by explaining our
            service offering and recommending what's best for the customer.

        <p><span>Barman, Waiter, Shop assistant, Chef 05/14 to 01/15.</span><br>
            I initially worked as a part time waiter. The front of house role enabled me to provide an excellent service

            areas of the holiday park. These included: Waiter, Barman , Shop Supervisor, Pizza chef and Desert chef.
            <br>
            Dealing with a large range of diverse customers, having multiple job roles, in a fast paced environment gave

            from all over the world. This role required prioritisation and flexibility. I thrived on the fast paced
            environment where I had to make decisions on a regular basis to meet the needs of customers and in line with
            the company regulations.

        <h3>GILLETS SPAR</h3>
        <p><span>Shop assistant 09/13 to 07/14.</span><br>
            My role at Gillets was much the same as my role at Martin Mcolls.
            During my time here I further developed my customer service skills to provide the best experience for
            customers.
            This role had additional responsibility to manage the baking of fresh goods. I completed shift work - early,
            late and at weekends. Following the company standards, I worked and ensured the safety of our customers. I
            managed stock on the shop floor to ensure goods were available to customers and well presented. Being a
            local shop at times I had to manage conflict situations where underage customers attempted to purchase age
            restricted goods.
        </p>
        <h3>MARTIN MCOLLS</h3>
        <p><span>Shop assistant 11/12 to 09/13.</span><br>
            My role was primarily customer service based. Providing excellent customer service by assisting customers
            and meeting their individual needs. Through excellent listening skills I could understand customer's
            requirements and provide solutions when necessary. I adhered to cash regulations when retailing goods
            through the till. I was responsible for cashing up at the end of my shift. My experience in this role is
            relevant to the job I am applying for as it was customer service based.
            I worked well as part of a team and on my own where necessary to complete my duties.
